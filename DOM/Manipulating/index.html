As AMAZING SPIDER-MAN swings toward a landmark 200th issue, Peter's ailing Aunt May is hanging on by a thread. When the man who killed Uncle Ben returns, Peter is faced with a chilling choice. Then, Felicia Hardy - the Black Cat - makes her first appearance, Mysterio weaves his illusions, Spidey faces Doc Ock in an Annual extravaganza and a gang war forces a team-up with the Punisher! With a little disco Dazzler for added excitement, you'll love every page.
